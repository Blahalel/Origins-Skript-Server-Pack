Hi! This was a personal project by some friends and
I for our server.
If you find bugs, feel completely free to contact my Discord at "blahalel"

This requires no Skript addons, HOWEVER, you must add your own custom recipes if you'd like to add an Orb of Origin recipe.
This Skript is for 1.20.6+, so if an older version is used, major parts of origins may be **missing**!!!
Of course, one requirement is the Skript plugin which this is built on :)

Good luck, have fun! o/
